# Cyclostationary-Signal-Processing

Many natural and manmade processes have periodic statistical characteristics. These processes are called cyclostationary and they are commonly encountered in various fields of science and technology, such as climatology, mechanics, astronomy and communications. For instance, in communications, periodicity is typically induced by modulation, sampling, and multiplexing operations.

Currently, this project deals with the detection of discrete-time almost-cyclostationarity. A potential application of such a detector is cognitive radio, where we need to detect vacant communication channels by spectrum sensing.
