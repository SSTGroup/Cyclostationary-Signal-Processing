# Abstract
This work presents a technique to detect whether a signal is almost cyclostationary (ACS) or wide-sense stationary (WSS). Commonly, ACS (and also CS) detectors require a priori knowledge of the cycle period, which in the ACS case is not an integer. To tackle the case of unknown cycle period, we propose an approach that combines a resampling technique, which handles the fractional part of the cycle period and allows the use of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), with a multiple hypothesis test, which handles the integer part of the cycle period. We control the probability of false alarm based on the known distribution of the individual GLRT statistic, results from order statistics, and the Holm multiple test procedure. To evaluate the performance of the proposed detector we consider a communications example, where simulation results show that the proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art competitors.
