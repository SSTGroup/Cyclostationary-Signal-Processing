# Description

Files implementing the GLRT for the two-channel passive detection problem by exploiting cyclostationarity proposed in the paper “Two-channel passive detection exploiting cyclostationarity” by S. Horstmann, D. Ramirez, and P. J. Schreier, accepted for EUSIPCO, 2019.

Furthermore, the files also include the LMPIT-inspired test for the same problem as derived in "Two-Channel Passive Detection of Cyclostationary Signals" by S. Horstmann, D. Ramirez, and P.J. Schreier, submitted in IEEE Transaction on Signal Processing, June 2019.

# Abstract
This paper addresses a two-channel passive detection
problem exploiting cyclostationarity. Given a reference
channel (RC) and a surveillance channel (SC), the goal is to
detect a target echo present at the surveillance array transmitted
by an illuminator of opportunity equipped with multiple antennas.
Since common transmission signals are cyclostationary, we
exploit this information at the detector. Specifically, we derive an
asymptotic generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to detect the
presence of a cyclostationary signal at the SC given observations
from RC and SC. This detector tests for different covariance
structures. Simulation results show good performance of the
proposed detector compared to competing techniques that do
not exploit cyclostationarity.
